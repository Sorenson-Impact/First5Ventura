#### A report prepared by the data science team on behalf of First 5 Ventura.

##### Pagebreak

## Data Analysis 

We were asked to analyze data on preschoolers funded through First 5 Ventura, in order to understand the demographics of the preschoolers they have and are currently funding. First 5 Ventura has datasets that include preschooler information, including preschool attended and demographics, as well as family demographic information. These datasets are connected using family ID or client ID. Not every preschooler has had their family demographic information collected, so the preschooler demographics are more complete than the family demographics. 

In the first table below, Table 1, we look at the total number of preschoolers funded by First 5 Ventura by School Year. First 5 Ventura has let us know that their data is most accurate for school years 2016-2017 and 2017-2018.  

#### Table 1. Total Preschoolers Served by First5 Ventura by Year

```{r merged and deduplicated data, echo=FALSE}

distinct_rowstotal %>% 
   group_by(school_year) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
 # mutate(perc=(count/sum(count)*100)) %>% 
  kable(., col.names = c("School Year", "Number of Students"))

```



<!-- The graph below shows the same  -->

<!-- ```{r, echo=FALSE} -->

<!-- distinct_rowstotal %>%  -->
<!--    group_by(school_year) %>% -->
<!--   summarise(count = n()) %>%  -->
<!--   ggplot(aes(x=school_year, y=count)) + -->
<!--   geom_col()+ -->
<!--   labs(x="School Year", y="Total Number") + -->
<!--   ggtitle("Total Number of Preschoolers by School Year") -->
<!-- ``` -->

### Census Comparisons to First 5 Ventura Population

First 5 Ventura was interested in comparing the families they serve with the general census population in the same zip codes. We took American Census Survey (ACS) data from 2015 and compared it to the same zip codes served by First 5 Ventura. Using the First 5 Ventura family demographics information, both the income and the number of household members, we were able to calculate federal poverty level for each family for whom we had data. The ACS has estimates on the number of families in each Zip Code that are at a certain percent of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL). The graphs below compare the federal poverty line data for First 5 Ventura to the ACS data. We find that First 5 Ventura is serving a population that is much further below the FPL than the general population.
