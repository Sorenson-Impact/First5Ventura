# Summary 

We were asked to conduct a quick analysis of the income level of the 2017-2018 First 5 Ventura County preschool slots. 

We calculated the Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for each preschooler for whom we had income and household size. Federal Poverty Level is a function of income level and household size. Our calculation is only an estimate of FPL, as we only had income buckets and not an exact number for yearly household income. 

We also calculate the percent of the California Median Income for FFY 2017 for each preschooler in the 2017-2018 school year for whom we income and household size. The California State Median Income for FFY 2017 is taken from the LIHEAP Clearinghouse website, which is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/Tribes/Tables/povertytables/FY2017/casmi_tribal.htm

### Number of Preschool Slots 2017-2018

First 5 Ventura County funded a total of 659 slots in 2017-2018 (according to the data received from First 5 Ventura County). We have household income for 583 of those preschoolers and household size for 222 of those preschoolers. The following table and graph show the number of preschool slots funded by First 5 Ventura County by agency name in 2017-2018.

### California State Median Income Level by Preschool

The following graphs calculate the percent of the California Median Income for FFY 2017 for each preschool in the 2017-2018 school year. The California State Median Income for FFY 2017 is taken from the LIHEAP Clearinghouse website, which is a division of the Department of Health and Human Services.[(https://liheapch.acf.hhs.gov/Tribes/Tables/povertytables/FY2017/casmi_tribal.htm)]

The first table displays the total number of First 5 Ventura County slots, the number of CSPP eligible slots, and the percent of households that were in a First 5 Ventura County slot who were CSPP eligible by agency. The first graph visualizes the mean California State Median Income Level by preschool. The second graph shows a scatterplot of the California State Median Income Level for each agency.
